# Matrix-Multiplication-using-Apache-Spark-and-Map-Reduce

Implement matrix multiplication in Map-Reduce. Using two Map-Reduce jobs in the same Java file. There are two small sparce matrices 4*3 and 3*3 in the files M-matrix-small.txt and N-matrix-small.txt for testing in standalone mode. Their matrix multiplication must return the 4*3 matrix in result-matrix-small.txt. Then there are 2 moderate-sized matrices 200*100 and 100*300 in the files M-matrix-large.txt and M-matrix-large.txt for testing in distributed mode.
